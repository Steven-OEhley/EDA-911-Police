# EDA-911-Police
This was my final capstone project for Level 2 of the Hyperion Data Science Bootcamp. 


The analysis gives a break down of how calls can be broken down by day, month, year, priority and district. Presenting the composition and trend of each.    
However, the ultimate story in the data, was the tragic story of Freddie Grey.    
The incident was totally unknown to me when beginning my data exploration. When identifying unique patterns in the data, these were followed up with online searches and investigations. The first was getting an understanding of the seasons in Baltimore to understand why calls increased sharply during certain months.      
The second investigation was why community engagement as a call description only appeared from 2019 and why business check-ins increased so drastically. The data showed how sharply calls increased from 2019 onwards. After further investigation into why Community Engagement and Business Check-ins had increased so much it was found to be due to Baltimore Police focusing on Community Engagement and Community Policing after the death of Freddie Grey in 2015. The Police, through these initiatives hoped to restore the Police department and communityâ€™s relationship.
